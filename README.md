# trumpTweetsVisualisation
Just learning some stuff

# TODO
1. store to db; write script for initializing database (pull all tweets at first. later on just update with the new ones)
2. implement elastic search
3. visualise data (display the most used words). For start they will be predefined. In the future it would be good to allow user to choose which words he want to be displayed (after elastic search is implemented).
